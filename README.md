# Lavonte Thomas & lmthomas1@my.waketech.edu
# I have a student GitHub account.
# I created a repository named lmthomas12.github.io.
# I am going to describe the steps that I took to clone the repository to my local machine. I downloaded the Desktop GitHub version on to my local machine then signed in with my email that was used during account creating. I selected the repo that I want to clone once I logged into the desktop version then just clicked clone repository.  Before cloning, I had to choose a folder to store the clone.
